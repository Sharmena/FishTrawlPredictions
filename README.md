# FishTrawlPredictions
Using plankton cell counts to predict fish trawl survey data with machine learning in Python

This is a project for my Biological Oceanography class at the URI GSO. We could choose any topic with the requirement of making new observations from an already existing data set. To see the original data, visit URI's website and look for the fish trawl survey and the Narragansett Bay Long-Term Plankton Time Series.
